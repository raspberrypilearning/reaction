## 들어가며

You are going to create a 2-player game to see who has the fastest reactions. The game will work by showing an image after a random amount of time - whoever presses their button first is the winner.

**Instructions**: If you're reading this online, wait for an image to display on the micro:bit below and then press **A** or **B** first to see who is the fastest.

## 소개

In this project, children will make a reaction game. An image will be displayed on the micro:bit after a random amount of time - the first person to press their button is the winner.

Children will make use of all of the coding concepts used in previous projects, as well as using Boolean operators to wait until a button has been pressed.

## 자료

For this project, the [MakeCode (PXT)](http://jumpto.cc/pxt-new) microbit editor should be used.

You can find a completed version of this project at [makecode.microbit.org/#pub:50800-81674-84873-32898 ](https://makecode.microbit.org/#pub:50800-81674-84873-32898), and the compiled .hex file can be downloaded by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ microbit-Reaction.hex

There is also a version of the project with the "Keep score" challenge completed. This can be found at [makecode.microbit.org/#pub:23812-11544-45113-45147 ](https://makecode.microbit.org/#pub:23812-11544-45113-45147), and the compiled .hex file can be downloaded by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ microbit-Reaction-Score.hex

## 학습 목표

+ Boolean operators: 
    + AND;
    + NOT.

이 프로젝트는 [라즈베리파이 디지털 메이킹 커리큘럼](http://rpf.io/curriculum) 중 아래의 과정에 있는 요소들을 다룹니다.

+ [기본 프로그래밍 문법으로 간단한 프로그램 만들기](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

## 도전과제

+ "Choose your own image" - changing the image displayed on the micro:bit.
+ "Choose your own delay" - changing the parameters to the `random` function.
+ "Keep score" - use variables to keep track of player scores.
