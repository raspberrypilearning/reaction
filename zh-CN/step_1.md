## 简介

You are going to create a 2-player game to see who has the fastest reactions. The game will work by showing an image after a random amount of time - whoever presses their button first is the winner.

**Instructions**: If you're reading this online, wait for an image to display on the micro:bit below and then press **A** or **B** first to see who is the fastest.

## 简介

In this project, children will make a reaction game. An image will be displayed on the micro:bit after a random amount of time - the first person to press their button is the winner.

Children will make use of all of the coding concepts used in previous projects, as well as using Boolean operators to wait until a button has been pressed.

## 资源

For this project, the [MakeCode (PXT)](http://jumpto.cc/pxt-new) microbit editor should be used.

You can find a completed version of this project at [makecode.microbit.org/#pub:50800-81674-84873-32898 ](https://makecode.microbit.org/#pub:50800-81674-84873-32898), and the compiled .hex file can be downloaded by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ microbit-Reaction.hex

There is also a version of the project with the "Keep score" challenge completed. This can be found at [makecode.microbit.org/#pub:23812-11544-45113-45147 ](https://makecode.microbit.org/#pub:23812-11544-45113-45147), and the compiled .hex file can be downloaded by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ microbit-Reaction-Score.hex

## 学习目标

+ Boolean operators: 
    + AND;
    + NOT.

本项目涵盖[树莓派数字制作课程](http://rpf.io/curriculum)如下几方面内容：

+ [利用基本编程结构创建简单程序。](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

## 挑战

+ "Choose your own image" - changing the image displayed on the micro:bit.
+ "Choose your own delay" - changing the parameters to the `random` function.
+ "Keep score" - use variables to keep track of player scores.
